    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (225g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups (400g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (75g) cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (175g) chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x9-inch (23x23cm) baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easier removal.</li>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter. Once melted, add the granulated sugar and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>If desired, fold in the chocolate chips or chopped chocolate to add extra chocolatey goodness to your brownies.</li>
        <li>Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Remember that baking times may vary, so keep an eye on them starting around the 20-minute mark.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool completely in the pan before cutting into hearts or squares.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy your homemade chocolate brownies! They can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for several days.</li>
